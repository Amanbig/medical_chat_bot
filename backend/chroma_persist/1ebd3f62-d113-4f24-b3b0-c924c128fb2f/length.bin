This helps define treatment proto-col and prognosis. After surgical treatment, the final, orpathologic, stage is defined as the true axillary lymphnode status is known. Detailed staging criteria are avail-able from the American Joint Commission on CancerManual and are generalized here:\n\u2022 Stage 1\u2014The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in) and\nno cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.\n\u2022 Stage 2\u2014The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm, and the\ncancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\n\u2022 Stage 3A\u2014Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is small-\ner than 5 cm, but has spread to the lymph nodes, whichhave grown into each other.\n\u2022 Stage 3B\u2014Cancer has spread to tissues near the breast,\n(local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside the chestwall, along the breastbone.\n\u2022 Stage 4\u2014Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes\nbeyond the axilla or to other organs of the body.\nTreatment\nSurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are all uti-\nlized in the treatment of breast cancer. Depending on thestage, they will be used in different combinations orsequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the typeand stage of the disease being treated.\nSURGERY. Historically, surgical removal of the\nentire breast and axillary contents along with the musclesdown to the chest wall was performed as the lone thera-py, (radical mastectomy ). In the last twenty-five years,\nas it has been appreciated that breast cancer is often sys-temic early in its course, the role of surgery is still prima-ry but of less and less magnitude.\nToday, surgical treatment is best thought of as a\ncombination of removal of the primary tumor and stag-ing of the axillary lymph nodes. If the whole breast isremoved along with the entire axillary contents, but themuscles of the chest wall are not, the modified radicalmastectomy has been performed.\nIf the tumor is less than 1.5 in (4 cm) in size and\nlocated so that it can be removed without destroying areasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual breast,just the primary tumor and a rim of normal tissue will beremoved. The axillary nodes will still be removed forstaging purposes, usually through a separate incision.Because of the risk of recurrence in the remaining breasttissue, radiation is used to lessen the chance of localrecurrence. This type of primary therapy is known as\nlumpectomy , (or segmental mastectomy), and axillary\ndissection.\nCurrently the necessary extent of the axillary dissec-\ntion is being questioned. Sentinel lymph node biopsy ,a\ntechnique for identifying which nodes in the axilla drainthe tumor, has been developed to provide selective sam-pling and further lessen the degree of surgical trauma thepatient experiences.\nWhen patients are selected appropriately based on\nthe preoperative clinical stage, all of these surgicalapproaches have been shown to produce similar results.In planning primary surgical therapy, it is imperative thatthe operation is tailored to fit the clinical circumstance ofthe patient.\nThe pathologic stage is determined after surgical\ntreatment absolutely defines the local parameters. Inaddition to stage, there are other tests that are very neces-sary to aid in decisions regarding treatment. Handling ofthe surgical specimen is thus very important.
