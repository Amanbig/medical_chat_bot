Thebra will need to be worn around the clock for several weeks.Stitches are removed one to three weeks after the operation.Normal activities, including sexual relations may be restrict-ed for several weeks. Scars will typically remain red, andperhaps lumpy for up to several months, but will graduallyfade and become less noticeable.

Weber, MSN\nBreast self-examination\nDefinition\nA breast self-examination (BSE) is an inspection by\na woman of her breasts to detect breast cancer .\nPurpose\nA BSE is one of three tests the American Cancer\nSociety recommends to help detect breast cancer in itsearliest stages. By regularly examining her own breasts, awoman is more likely to find any changes that may haveoccurred. The best time to perform a BSE is about a weekafter a woman\u2019s period ends, when her breasts are not ten-der or swollen. If her periods are not regular, a BSEshould be completed on the same day every month. ABSE should also be regularly completed by women whoare pregnant, breastfeeding, or have breast implants . By\ncombining a BSE with a mammography and clinical\nbreast examination, a woman is offered the best opportu-nity for reducing chances of death from breast cancer\nthrough early detection. Close to 90% of breast cancersare found through a BSE. The American Cancer Societyrecommends that beginning at the age of 20, women com-plete a BSE each month by feeling for lumps or anythingsuspicious, as well as looking at their breasts carefully ina mirror for any changes in contour, swelling, dimpling,puckering of the skin, or changes in the nipple.\nDescription\nTo complete a monthly BSE:\n\u2022 When lying down, place a pillow under the right shoul-\nder and position the right arm behind the head. Usingthe finger pads of the three middle fingers on the lefthand, check the entire breast area. Use small circles andfollow an up-and-down pattern while pressing firmlyenough to know how the breast feels from month tomonth.
